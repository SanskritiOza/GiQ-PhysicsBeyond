	any letter
	any number
	both one and zero
		one or zero

2. Why is a new computing paradigm needed?
	Computers can help more with food production.
	Existing computers are contributing to the climate change problem.
	Existing technology causes too much social disruption due to screen time.
		Current computing capabilities are reaching physical limits.

3. With current electricity, electrons are _____.
	flowing through an insulating material
	flowing through a switch, even if it's in the off position
		moving from atom to atom
	tied to a particular atom

# Introduction to Quantum Computing
1. What does the Heisenberg uncertainty principle state?
	There are many particles, including protons and neutrons.
	Energy has a quantum nature.
		A more accurate knowledge of a particle position reduces our knowledge of its momentum.
	Electric radiation has properties of both a wave and a particle.

2. The phenomenon that occurs when two particles respond to each other, even when they have no physical connection between them, is called _____.
		entanglement
	decoherence
	predetermination
	spin-down

3. What is quantum mechanics?
	the unified theory of everything
	the theory that explains how light behaves under classical physics
	a method to connect multiple transistors to work in tandem in one circuit
		the ability to describe the interaction and motion of subatomic particles

4. What advantage does quantum computing offer over classic computing?
	faster processing of zeros and ones
	supporting additional binary numbers
		processing multiple states in parallel
	running calculations on a remote computer
